Version Control :

Every time you save the file gets updated.
Make file -> Compile only those files which have been modified.
Group of programmers working on a project -> Modular approach where there are lots and lots of codes and files in a 
mega project.
Each programmer can work on a typical alloted file.
Each programmer has many different versions of each file they work on.
Version control is there to help us trace back to working version of the code.
No. of versions = # of users x # of files x # of different versions per file.

Different verison control systms : 
1] SVN : Centrally hosted and managed version system
2] GIT : Distributed version control system

There are techniques available in order to mitigate the failure of storage systems like hard disks 
RAID(Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is one such technique. Data is distributed across multiple disks in one of 
several ways so that if one disk fails then the data is available on other disks. 
In a RAID system usage space < actual space.

How to clone a repository on your local machine from github ?
git clone url_of_repository.git (You need to add .git at the end)

Use "git init" to initialize the connection with your local machine.
gut remote add master url_of_repository -> will create a master file with local machine
git config --global user.name "name of the user" -> checks whether something has to be done with that user's material.
git config --global user.email "emailid" -> will verify the email address
git status -> checks what have you modified 
git add file_modified -> will update corresponding file on repository online
git commit -m "Message that you want to notify"  -> Notifies everyone what have you modified in the message.
